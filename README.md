# Telescope_tracking

Auto-track the sky with your dobsonian telescope! Preserve the manual exploration of the night sky without having to continuously fine-adjust for high magnification targets. Based on Arduino Uno, this sketch is intended to track the current position when the telescope slewed to any position in the sky by keypad. This means no GO-TO, no object catalogue, just assisted manual viewing.

The goal of this repo is to eventually contain all the sketches, schematics, CAD files and parts list for building your own DIY tracker for a dobsonian telescope.
